* Originally by iX (November 02, 2016) [iX Other Designs on thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/ix__/designs)
* Extended by mofosyne for punchcut support for reduce material requirement and print time (February 20, 2022)
    - Inspired by lokabayashi remix of iX's design [lokabayashi other designs](https://www.thingiverse.com/lokabayashi/designs)
    - Also added support for screw mounting as an option

## Settings

In OpenSCAD you can set :
* The number of slots in Y and X direction
* The diameter of the honeycombs
* The height of the honeycombs
* The thickness of the walls

This current script which is good enough for most USB cables uses these set of parameters, assuming the usage of a standard 0.4mm nozzle.

```
cable_slot_height = 120; // depth of the slots
cable_slot_diameter = 42; // diameter of the slots
nozzle = 0.4;
nb_of_outer_shell = 3;
```

If mounting holes is enabled, by default these are the values chosen. Which was picked due to it use in some V-slot T-slot screws (10mm).

```
drillholeDiameter=8;
countersunkDiameter=15;
countersunkHeight=2;
```

## Options Available

* `I_want_a_surrounding_wall` : (default: false) set this bit to 1 if you want a square wall surrounding your cable hive. It is better to set option "I_wish_to_combine_it_later" to 0 to have nice surrounding wall
* `I_wish_to_combine_it_later` : (default: false) will add a slot on all odd Y lines so that you will be able to concatenate this part with an other on
* `I_want_side_wall_punch` : (default: true) set this bit to 1 to reduce material requirement
* `I_want_mounting_screw_holes` : (default: false)`set this bit to 1 to add mounting hole
* `I_want_lengthwise_cuts` : (default: false) set this bit to 1 to add extra internal cuts (e.g. business cards)

## 4x5 Cable Output Spec

* External honeycomb diameter is : 42
* Internal honeycomb diameter is : 39.1594
* Requested wall width is : 1.23
* The real wall width in X is : 1.23
* The real wall width in Y is : 1.42028
* External honeycomb X size is  : 36.3731
* External honeycomb Y size is : 42
* Internal honeycomb X size is  : 33.9131
* Internal honeycomb Y size is : 39.1594
* Pitch in X is : 35.1431
* Pitch bis in X is : 35.1431
* Pitch in Y is : 30.4348
* Pitch bis in Y is : 30.4348
* Its dimensions are X = 143.955 and Y = 163.289
* You have a total number of 20 slots to host your silly cables :)

## 6x5 Business Cards Hive Spec

Similar to 4x5 Cable Output Spec, but specifically:
* 6x5 slots instead so that two cards can be placed per row
* slot height is 60mm instead of 120mm
